    <p>Elison Tejada</p>
    I have been married for 23 years. We have 2 children. The oldest is 18 and the youngest is 17 years old. I baptized in the church in 2001. My wife introduced me to the gospel. We got married one month before I baptized.
    I wanted to apply for a job in programming and web development and I need this knowledge.
    I got my bachelor's degree in System Engineering on 2010. I am working as a help desk, but I am freelance. I want to apply for better jobs, so I that's why I am preparing myself.
    I love that we can apply the gospel when we are studying BYUI provide for me that.
    One of the most thing that I love is to cook for my family and friends.
     I like to watch SciFy movies.</p>
